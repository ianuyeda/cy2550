I didn't really look into any other password managers other than LastPass. I had chosen to use LastPass a long time ago because I had wanted to increase security. At the time it was the only one that I knew of and I have been using it for a few years now. All of my passwords are randomly generated 16-char passwords that contain uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. I have memorized one "random" password that serves as my entry point into my vault.
